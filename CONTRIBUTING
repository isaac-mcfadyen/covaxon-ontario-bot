# Contributing

All contributions are welcome! Please make sure your Pull Request conforms to the following guidelines before submitting.

1. Your pull request should keep the general idea of the original code intact; if you have added a new vaccine provider, that's great! However, monitoring Covaxon Ontario should still be possible.
2. Your pull request should have code comments. Comments are helpful to people learning Python, as well as experienced coders extending functionality.
3. Your pull request must have a detailed explanation of what you have changed and why.

Don't be upset if your Pull Request is rejected. Instead, act on any feedback you have received and try submitting again.
